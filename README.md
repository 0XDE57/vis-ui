VisSceneEditor
==============

VisSceneEditor is a real-time simple 2D scene editor for Libgdx.

It allows you to easily adjust position, scale and rotation of sprites or any other objects in game. Files are saved in json format.

See wiki for more information on how to use it:

Please don't be confused that it is only scene2d editor, although it can support Actor, it's not perfect. Sprite support works a lot better, support for scene2d.ui is pretty good though.
