=========

[VisEditor](http://vis.kotcrab.com/) is cross platform 2d game level editor, it allows to easily create game scenes using drag and drop editor. 

VisEditor doesn't force you to use single game framework, scenes are exported in JSON format. Many file formats are supported: images, sounds, particles, shaders, Spine animations and more coming soon. Box2d physics is supported as well.

See [Quick Start](https://github.com/kotcrab/VisEditor/wiki/Quick-Start) guide.

#### Runtime
VisEditor currently have libGDX runtime using [artemis-odb](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb) for entity-component-system framework. With that runtime you can load your scene in just few lines of code.

LibGDX runtime is a good start if you want to write your own runtime, if you do so don't forget to let me now and I will link it here.
