We are glad that you would like to contribute to the Vis Project. Here are some guidelines that you should follow when making you contributions.

#### Git commits messages
* Use sentence case ("Added feature" not "added feature")
* Don't use dots, exclamation or question marks at the end of commit message.

#### Code Formatter
We require you to use code formatter when making your pull request. Code formatter for IntelliJ IDEA can be found in root directory of this repository. If you are using Eclipse then
you must use [libGDX Eclipse formatter](https://github.com/kotcrab/libgdx/blob/master/eclipse-formatter.xml).

To install formatter in Eclipse simply import xml file from settings window.

To install formatter in IntelliJ IDEA copy xml to config directory, restart IDE, then select formatter from settings.  
Mac OS X: `~/Library/Preferences/.IdeaIC14/codestyles/`  
Linux: `~/.IdeaIC14/config/codeStyles/`  
Windows: `<User home>\.IdeaIC14\config\codeStyles\`

`.IdeaIC14` directory may be named different depending on your IDEA version

#### Code Style
Please follow [libGDX code style](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style).

Thanks!
